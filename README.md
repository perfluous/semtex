# SEMTEX
SEMTEX is one of several overarching projects. It aims to converge several large unrelated projects into multiple converging systems.
Several projects aim to create research services and/or new markets. Others aim to increase quality of life in general.
For example, specifically aiming for an increase in neuroplasticity, dopamine release, androgenic activity, and adaptogenic effects. While at the same time being anticarcinogtic, anti-infammator.
This will then be marketed together with <REDACTED> to create a demand for <REDACTED>. This in turn will increase supplement testing, and bring a cheap way for people to masure their current health status. Which will bring a huge boost in (anonymised) health data.

This is a huge project and before anything I must get my dotfiles in order, generate income for the server, complete AutoGen and dotfiles (semtex-spikemr).

## SEMTEX: CustosMycetorum
Mushroom cultivation, pro-biotics brewing. Will in the future become an automated system.
Starts with selling mushrooms, wil grow towards extracting supplemental, medicinal, and <REDACTED> compounds.
This will be subdivided into multiple projects once the precice plans are there.
> Currently there are:
> - documents
>   - growtypes
>   - compounds
>   - brewing specifics
>   - etc
> - CAD files
> - partial P&ID
> - Market analysis
> - Materials for production start (minus ~â‚¬5k)

> Base requirements for physical automization start (birdseye view):
> - Supply Chain Management
> - Legal
> - Operations
> - Food Safety
> - Environmental Management
> - Quality Assurance
> - Research And Development
> - IT
> - Finance
> - Engineering
> - Project Management
> - Marketing

## SEMTEX: ROME
### CustosMemoriam
Aims to gather historical data from local sources. First from Dutch local sources, later European sources. The plan is to implement a (currently testing) system which will insentanvice historias and hobbyists to transcribe their found documents cheaply and easily.
Unlike Transkribus, this data will be made public and open-source (if allowed).
This will then be added to vector database (ChromaDB), which will be attached to the CustosMemoriam LLM. Once a proper error rate has been achieved, it will be published together with the data source to aid in research for resaerchers, hobbyists, and professionals.
Here a test with AutoGen will be run in order to test the feasability of a later project.
